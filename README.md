# Spectral-Clustering

Spectral clustering for image segmentation and graph partition. This work is based on the works by Ulrike von Luxburg [1], Shi and Malik [2] and Ng, Jordan and Weiss [3]. 

# Contents

In this repository, we've put together some Jupyter notebooks and MAtlab codes to give an example of Spectral Clustering Algorithms. This repository is aimed at illustrating people who want to learn the basic algorithms of this family of algorithms.
